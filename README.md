# Surfs_Up
## Overview

We were asked by the client, W. Avy, to analyze weather conditions in Oahu. W. Avy needs investors for his Surf n' Shake shop, and would like to show that the weather will not cause the business to fail, but that it is in fact well worth investing in.

### Resources
Data source: [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/boggesstristyn/surfs_up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite)

Software: Jupyter Notebooks, conda 4.12.0, Python 3.7.3, VS Code 1.67.2, SQLite, SQLAlchemy.

Our results from all of the observations that were recorded in the month of June and December:

- The average temperature is in the 70's.

- Both June and December showed similar min/max and average temperatures.

- The assumption is that the temperature does not have dramatic fluctuations throughout the year.

## Summary

After reviewing the results, based on temperatures it is likely that a surf and ice cream shop would do well in both the summer and winter months. Although slightly cooler, the temperatures in December remain acceptable for both outdoor activities and ice cream. The average temperatures for both June and December were nearly 75 degrees and 71 degrees.
Because the evenings in December will be a bit cooler, the surf and ice cream shop could consider reducing operating hours to daytime to reduce costs.
It would be beneficial to provide W. Avy with additional weather data, more than just temperature and precipitation. Wind speed would factor heavily into surfing conditions and should be further explored. Another weather phenomena to analyze would be tropical storms and hurricanes, which could be detrimental to the building.
